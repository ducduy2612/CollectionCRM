## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Integration challenges with legacy systems | High | Medium | Early proof-of-concept, dedicated integration team |
| Performance issues with large data volume | High | Medium | Performance testing early, scalable architecture |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Strict change management process, regular scope reviews |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Medium | Cross-training team members, flexible resource allocation |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Regular security audits, secure coding practices |

## Governance Structure
