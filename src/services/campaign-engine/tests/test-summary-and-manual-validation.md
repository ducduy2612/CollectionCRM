## 🔍 Manual Validation Commands

### Check Test Data
```sql
-- Verify customer distribution by segment and DPD
SELECT 
    segment, 
    COUNT(*) as customers,
    AVG(total_outstanding) as avg_outstanding,
    MAX(highest_dpd) as max_dpd_in_segment
FROM (
    SELECT 
        cif, segment, 
        SUM(client_outstanding) as total_outstanding,
        MAX(max_dpd) as highest_dpd
    FROM bank_sync_service.loan_campaign_data 
    WHERE cif LIKE 'TEST%' 
    GROUP BY cif, segment
) customer_summary
GROUP BY segment
ORDER BY segment;
```

### Test Campaign Targeting
```sql
-- Test Critical DPD Campaign conditions
SELECT cif, max_dpd, client_outstanding, segment
FROM bank_sync_service.loan_campaign_data 
WHERE cif LIKE 'TEST%' 
  AND max_dpd > 60 
  AND loan_status = 'OPEN';

-- Test High Risk Score Campaign conditions  
SELECT lcd.cif, lcd.segment, (lcf.fields->>'risk_score')::int as risk_score
FROM bank_sync_service.loan_campaign_data lcd
JOIN bank_sync_service.loan_custom_fields lcf ON lcd.account_number = lcf.account_number
WHERE lcd.cif LIKE 'TEST%' 
  AND (lcf.fields->>'risk_score')::int >= 8;

-- Test Premium Customer conditions
SELECT cif, segment, max_dpd, client_outstanding
FROM bank_sync_service.loan_campaign_data 
WHERE cif LIKE 'TEST%' 
  AND segment = 'PREMIUM' 
  AND max_dpd > 0 
  AND max_dpd <= 30;
```

### Verify Contact Data
```sql
-- Check contact availability across sources
SELECT 
    'bank_sync' as source,
    COUNT(DISTINCT cif) as customers_with_contacts,
    COUNT(*) as total_contacts
FROM bank_sync_service.phones 
WHERE cif LIKE 'TEST%'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'workflow' as source,
    COUNT(DISTINCT cif) as customers_with_contacts,
    COUNT(*) as total_contacts
FROM workflow_service.phones 
WHERE cif LIKE 'TEST%';
```

## 🎯 Expected Processing Results

### Campaign Targeting Expectations:
1. **Critical DPD**: Should find TEST003 (90 DPD), TEST002 (60 DPD)
2. **High Risk Score**: Should find customers with risk_score >= 8 (TEST_LOAN_001, 002, 003, 010, 015)
3. **Large Outstanding**: Should find TEST004, TEST005, TEST007, TEST011, TEST013 (>100K)
4. **Premium Gentle**: Should find TEST004, TEST010 (PREMIUM + low DPD)

### Contact Selection Expectations:
