# Configuration Directory

This directory contains configuration files for the Collection CRM system.

## Purpose

These configuration files define settings for:
- Application behavior
- Environment-specific settings
- Feature flags
- Integration endpoints
- Security settings
- Logging configuration
- Performance tuning

## Structure

- Environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)
- Service-specific configurations
- Shared configurations
- Secret management (templates only, actual secrets should be managed securely)

## Usage

Configuration files should be loaded based on the current environment (NODE_ENV or similar).
Services should use a configuration management library to handle loading and validation of configuration.
